# <!> WARNING <!>
	The release of this application does not currently work as the letter
	recognizing library I am using is not currently allowed to be used
	outside of Visual Studio. Therefore, if you would like to run this program,
	please do so by importing this solution into visual studio.


# Information:
	This application allows you to select an area of text on your screen, 
	then take the recognized words and find any words that have that exact word inside them.
	(Example: showing the application 'test' would yield the following word: contest)
	This application was made for the web browser game 'BombParty' on a 1920x1080 display


# Installation:
	Go to the releases of this github page
	Download BombParty Test.exe
	Download words.txt
	Run BombParty Test.exe in the same folder as words.txt


# Usage:
	There are already preset parameters for the game BombParty and for the screen resolution 1920x1080
	However, this can be changed using the two buttons named 'Set Top Left' and 'Set Bottom Right'
	These buttons will change the parameters of the photo to wherever your cursor is
